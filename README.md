# Portable Joint Stiffness Quantification and Handgrip Assessment Unit
This project proposes a low-cost disease progression tracking system that measures stiffness in the Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joints and the ability of a patient to sustain grip - two key early indicators of RA. This system features a mechanical actuator that applies controlled angular flexion to the MCP joints at angles ranging from -30 ° to +60 ° and an FSR to measure the resistive force exerted by the finger on it, both of which will help measure the joint stiffness. The device will also have a load cell attached to a gripping unit that measures the force exerted on the load cell to calculate the grip strength.
